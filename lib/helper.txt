Run the migration:

bash
Copy
pgloader migrate.load

Check Network Configuration

If the database is hosted on a remote server, ensure that:

Firewall Rules:
Allow incoming connections on port 5432 (default PostgreSQL port).
For example, on Linux:
bash
Copy
sudo ufw allow 5432
PostgreSQL Configuration:
Ensure PostgreSQL is configured to accept remote connections.
Edit the pg_hba.conf file (usually located at /etc/postgresql/<version>/main/pg_hba.conf):
Copy
host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0               md5
Edit the postgresql.conf file (usually located at /etc/postgresql/<version>/main/postgresql.conf):
Copy
listen_addresses = '*'
To see the existing databases in PostgreSQL, you can use the `psql` command-line tool or run SQL queries. Here’s how you can do it:


   \l
   ```
   or

   \list
   

   This will display a list of all databases along with their owners, encoding, and access privileges.


sudo -u postgres psql -l



If you want to switch to a specific database (e.g., `shoperland`), use the following command in `psql`:


\c shoperland

- Use `\l` or `\list` in `psql` to list all databases.

--------------------------------------------------------------

1. Connect to PostgreSQL as a superuser (e.g., `postgres`):
   
   sudo -u postgres psql
   

2. Grant the `CREATEDB` privilege to the `admin` user:

   ALTER USER admin CREATEDB;


3. Verify the user’s privileges:
   
   \du

2. Run the migration:
  
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
